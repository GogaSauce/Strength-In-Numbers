Code and assets for Game-Off game jam submission. 
Credit to Layer Lab's for their chest from the Unity Asset Store. 
Thanks to mixkit.io for sound effects.  The castle in the icon was gotten from Pexels, by Ian Lavrinovich. Credit to them for the nice castle image.  Credit to imgflip.com for the shrugging meme in the losing scene.
 All code, and every other asset was created by me.
